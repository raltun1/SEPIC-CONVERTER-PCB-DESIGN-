This study successfully designed and controlled a SEPIC converter using an STM32 microcontroller. 
The simulations confirmed the effectiveness of the converter in handling both step-up and step-down voltage conversions. 
By implementing a PID control algorithm, stable and efficient output was achieved, despite challenges like switching losses and high-frequency control complexities. 
The results emphasize the importance of closed-loop control for stable operation, particularly in battery-powered systems. 
This work lays the groundwork for further research into SEPIC converters in power management applications.
